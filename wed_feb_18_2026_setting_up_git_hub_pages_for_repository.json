Under \"Build and deployment\", under \"Source\", select **GitHub Actions**.\n5. GitHub will suggest several workflow templates. If you already have a workflow to publish your site, you can skip this step. Otherwise, choose one of the options to create a GitHub Actions workflow. For more information about creating your custom workflow, see [Creating a custom GitHub Actions workflow to publish your site](#creating-a-custom-github-actions-workflow-to-publish-your-site).\n\n   GitHub Pages does not associate a specific workflow to the GitHub Pages settings. However, the GitHub Pages settings will link to the workflow run that most recently deployed your site.\n\n### Creating a custom GitHub Actions workflow to publish your site\n\nFor more information about GitHub Actions, see [GitHub Actions documentation](/en/actions).\n\nWhen you configure your site to publish with GitHub Actions, GitHub will suggest workflow templates for common publishing scenarios. The general flow of a workflow is to:\n\n1. Trigger whenever there is a push to the default branch of the repository or whenever the workflow is run manually from the Actions tab.\n2. Use the [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action to check out the repository contents.\n3. If required by your site, build any static site files.\n4. Use the [`actions/upload-pages-artifact`](https://github.com/actions/upload-pages-artifact) action to upload the static files as an artifact.\n5. If the workflow was triggered by a push to the default branch, use the [`actions/deploy-pages`](https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages) action to deploy the artifact. This step is skipped if the workflow was triggered by a pull request.\n\nThe workflow templates use a deployment environment called `github-pages`. If your repository does not already include an environment called `github-pages`, the environment will be created automatically. We recommend that you add a deployment protection rule so that only the default branch can deploy to this environment. For more information, see [Managing environments for deployment](/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment).\n\n> \\[!NOTE]\n> A `CNAME` file in your repository file does not automatically add or remove a custom domain. Instead, you must configure the custom domain through your repository settings or through the API. For more information, see [Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site](/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-g"

For more information, see [GitHub’s plans](/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans).\nView page as Markdown\n[About publishing sources](#about-publishing-sources)\n-----------------------------------------------------\nYou can publish your site when changes are pushed to a specific branch, or you can write a GitHub Actions workflow to publish your site.\nIf you do not need any control over the build process for your site, we recommend that you publish your site when changes are pushed to a specific branch. You can specify which branch and folder to use as your publishing source. The source branch can be any branch in your repository, and the source folder can either be the root of the repository (`/`) on the source branch or a `/docs` folder on the source branch. Whenever changes are pushed to the source branch, the changes in the source folder will be published to your GitHub Pages site.\nIf you want to use a build process other than Jekyll or you do not want a dedicated branch to hold your compiled static files, we recommend that you write a GitHub Actions workflow to publish your site. GitHub provides workflow templates for common publishing scenarios to help you write your workflow.\nWarning\nGitHub Pages sites are publicly available on the internet, even if the repository for the site is private (if your plan or organization allows it). If you have sensitive data in your site's repository, you may want to remove the data before publishing. For more information, see [About repositories](/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories#about-repository-visibility).\n[Publishing from a branch](#publishing-from-a-branch)\n-----------------------------------------------------\n1. Make sure the branch you want to use as your publishing source already exists in your repository.\n2. On GitHub, navigate to your site's repository.\n3.

Under \"Build and deployment\", under \"Source\", select **GitHub Actions**.\n5. GitHub will suggest several workflow templates. If you already have a workflow to publish your site, you can skip this step. Otherwise, choose one of the options to create a GitHub Actions workflow. For more information about creating your custom workflow, see [Creating a custom GitHub Actions workflow to publish your site](#creating-a-custom-github-actions-workflow-to-publish-your-site).\n\n   GitHub Pages does not associate a specific workflow to the GitHub Pages settings. However, the GitHub Pages settings will link to the workflow run that most recently deployed your site.\n\n### Creating a custom GitHub Actions workflow to publish your site\n\nFor more information about GitHub Actions, see [GitHub Actions documentation](/en/actions).\n\nWhen you configure your site to publish with GitHub Actions, GitHub will suggest workflow templates for common publishing scenarios. The general flow of a workflow is to:\n\n1. Trigger whenever there is a push to the default branch of the repository or whenever the workflow is run manually from the Actions tab.\n2. Use the [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action to check out the repository contents.\n3. If required by your site, build any static site files.\n4. Use the [`actions/upload-pages-artifact`](https://github.com/actions/upload-pages-artifact) action to upload the static files as an artifact.\n5. If the workflow was triggered by a push to the default branch, use the [`actions/deploy-pages`](https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages) action to deploy the artifact. This step is skipped if the workflow was triggered by a pull request.\n\nThe workflow templates use a deployment environment called `github-pages`. If your repository does not already include an environment called `github-pages`, the environment will be created automatically. We recommend that you add a deployment protection rule so that only the default branch can deploy to this environment. For more information, see [Managing environments for deployment](/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment).\n\n> \\[!NOTE]\n> A `CNAME` file in your repository file does not automatically add or remove a custom domain. Instead, you must configure the custom domain through your repository settings or through the API. For more information, see [Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site](/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-g"

For more information, see [GitHub’s plans](/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans).\nView page as Markdown\n[About publishing sources](#about-publishing-sources)\n-----------------------------------------------------\nYou can publish your site when changes are pushed to a specific branch, or you can write a GitHub Actions workflow to publish your site.\nIf you do not need any control over the build process for your site, we recommend that you publish your site when changes are pushed to a specific branch. You can specify which branch and folder to use as your publishing source. The source branch can be any branch in your repository, and the source folder can either be the root of the repository (`/`) on the source branch or a `/docs` folder on the source branch. Whenever changes are pushed to the source branch, the changes in the source folder will be published to your GitHub Pages site.\nIf you want to use a build process other than Jekyll or you do not want a dedicated branch to hold your compiled static files, we recommend that you write a GitHub Actions workflow to publish your site. GitHub provides workflow templates for common publishing scenarios to help you write your workflow.\nWarning\nGitHub Pages sites are publicly available on the internet, even if the repository for the site is private (if your plan or organization allows it). If you have sensitive data in your site's repository, you may want to remove the data before publishing. For more information, see [About repositories](/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories#about-repository-visibility).\n[Publishing from a branch](#publishing-from-a-branch)\n-----------------------------------------------------\n1. Make sure the branch you want to use as your publishing source already exists in your repository.\n2. On GitHub, navigate to your site's repository.\n3. Under your repository name, click **gear  Settings**. If you cannot see the \"Settings\" tab, select the **More**  dropdown menu, then click **Settings**.\n   ![Screenshot of a repository header showing the tabs.

Your GitHub Pages site is built and deployed with a GitHub Actions workflow. For more information, see [Viewing workflow run history](/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/viewing-workflow-run-history).\n    Note\n    GitHub Actions is free for public repositories. Usage charges apply for private and internal repositories that go beyond the monthly allotment of free minutes. For more information, see [Billing and usage](/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration).\nNote\n* If you are publishing from a branch and your site has not published automatically, make sure someone with admin permissions and a verified email address has pushed to the publishing source.\n* Commits pushed by a GitHub Actions workflow that uses the `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not trigger a GitHub Pages build.\n[Next steps](#next-steps)\n-------------------------\nTo add a new page or post to your site, see [Adding content to your GitHub Pages site using Jekyll](/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-content-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll).\nYou can add a Jekyll theme to your GitHub Pages site to customize the look and feel of your site.
